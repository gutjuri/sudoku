# sudoku

## Motivation

I'm getting real tired of solving sudokus, that's why I'd like to automate it. And while we're at it, we can also automate generating sudokus that we can solve by hand. Also, we'd like a nice GUI.

## Development Status

Currently, we can generate sudokus that have exactly one unique solution. We can solve sudokus with an arbitrary number of solutions. We don't have a gui yet.

## Known Issues

* Sudoku generation is very slow. The time needed for generation is non-deterministic, which means it can range from seconds up to several minutes.
